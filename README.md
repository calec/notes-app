# GrantsNotes

## Project Description

GrantsNotes is a collaborative note taking application. Logged in users are able to create as many notes as they like and share their notes with other users via email. Users that are not the owner of the note are only allowed to alter the contents of the note and not able to rename the title or delete it.

GrantsNotes is currently deployed at [https://grants-notes.herokuapp.com].
